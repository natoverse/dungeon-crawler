This version of the dungeon crawler is written in Python using a framework called [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/). This lets us write entirely Python code for the webpage.

## Setup

First, you need to have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine. If you aren't sure, open up a terminal and run `python --version`.

Steps to run the Dungeon Crawler:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the python folder. `cd <your git repo location>/python`
2. NiceGUI needs to be installed: `pip install nicegui`
3. Run the app: `python main.py`
