This is a simple dungeon crawler game to teach programming. The game functions much like an ASCII art Pac-Man: you move your character around the map using the arrow keys while avoiding the enemies. Eating the power up makes the enemies vulnerable, and you want to collect gold along the way. One you have collected all of the gold, the exit opens and you can complete the level.

There are two versions of this game. One is written in JavaScript and is entirely contained in a single webpage. See the [javascript](./javascript/) folder for this HTML file. You should just be able to run it directly in any modern browser. The second is written in Python. See the [python](./python) folder. This one has more setup and execution requirements, please see the [REAMDE](./python/README.md) for detailed instructions.
